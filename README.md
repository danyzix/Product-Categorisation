# Product-Categorisation
1. This an attempt at classifying a group of products into various product categories.
2. In this task, I've used various approaches using TF-IDF, Count-Vectors and Word-embeddings representations of the text data.
3. The classification tasks is tested based on traditional classification methods such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forests. I've also played with a simple neural network to classify the same products.
4. Finally, the last section of the notebook attempts to understand the underlying topics in the product corpus. To do that I've played with a Topic Modelling approach using Gensim's LDA model.
